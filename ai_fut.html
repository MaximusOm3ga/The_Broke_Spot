        The word AI or Artificial Intelligence is now thrown around like confetti at a party but people tend to forget that at its very core this is a synapse of complex neural networks with the power to usher in a golden age or plunge humanity into the depths of despair. As is with any attempt at man playing God, AI is currently in its infancy but in only a short time has come from the ages of ‘Clippy’, a program used to make your accessibility in windows easier to the likes of GPT-4 and AlphaGo that can mimic human behavioural patterns to a subtle perfection.
        <br />
        Humans have always strived to be better than yesterday and the new venture into the creation of synthetic minds as we know it is no different. AI has already taken over various aspect of the daily life; planning routines, making shopping lists as well as driving your car for you. When faced with a topic of creativity, post the influx of “Chat-GPT”, a student’s first response is to hear what the ones and zeroes think of it. This is not to say that these programs will regress the human mind, in fact they have the capability to do quite the opposite. For most of humanity’s existence we struggled just to survive, to get another meal but once that issue was sorted out, humans pursued their innate desire to create; poetry, sculptures, paintings, cuisine, these are only a few examples of what man does when man is truly free, so if AI completes the mundane for us, will we not have the ability to transcend the stars? The existence of a mechanical being bound by constraints that we can set only benefits us if we see it as a tool. If we were to become complacent using it, rest assured, any hope to harness the cosmos would die upon this land.
        <br />
        In the present stage the AI we witness as harbingers of new age are only trained upon the collective knowledge of humanity entrusted to the internet; but that is all they are trained upon: ‘Knowledge’. Knowledge is a powerful thing but without the ways to apply it in a meaningful way, it only rots as information. This is why as long as our AI models are trained in current methods, they will always just output information without one of the most important questions asked, “Why?”.  A neural network that grows with each input, understanding its existence while being perplexed by its past and mystified by the future is a synthetic being, an AI in its true essence, the future of ‘Artificial Intelligence’.
        <br />
        There exists an innate fear of the unknown within our primitive mind and the capabilities of an all-powerful AI very much invokes this. Whether this creation of code will deliver us to kingdom come or the dawn of tomorrow is to be seen but none can deny that whatever comes next was brought upon by our own hands and reshaping the earth has always been in play.
