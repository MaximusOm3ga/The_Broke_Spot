        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology with a major in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://vitap.ac.in/">VIT-AP University</a>.
            <br />
            I write just as a hobby to further improve my writing skills as well as maintain a certain amount of proficiency in the English language.
